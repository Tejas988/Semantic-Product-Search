# Enhanced Product Search & Recommendation System

## Overview
An intelligent **multimodal search engine** designed for modern e-commerce platforms, revolutionizing how users discover products.  
Instead of relying solely on basic keyword matching, this system **understands both images and text descriptions**, making product discovery **natural, intuitive, and accurate**.

---

## How It Works
1. **Upload an image** of any product **or** describe what you’re looking for.  
2. The system will:
   - **Identify** the product type (e.g., shoes, clothing, electronics).
   - **Find visually similar items** in that category.
   - **Extract brand information** if visible in the image.
   - **Prioritize** same-brand or similar-characteristic matches.
   - **Return ranked recommendations** that truly match your intent.

## Tentative Components

### CLIP Embeddings — *The Visual-Text Bridge*
- **Purpose:** Maps both text and images into the same embedding space.
- **Why it matters:**
  - Search using either **images** or **text**.
  - Understands high-level visual concepts like *“vintage style”* or *“professional look”*.
  - Finds visually similar products even when described differently.

### Sentence Transformer Embeddings — *Smart Text Understanding*
- **Purpose:** Goes beyond keyword matching to understand **semantic meaning**.
- **Enables:**
  - Matching `"comfortable running shoes"` with `"cushioned athletic footwear"`.
  - Understanding `"business casual shirt"` without exact phrase matching.
  - Context-aware product matching.

### Object Recognition — *Product Type Detection*
- **Purpose:** Detects the type of product in an uploaded image.
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents irrelevant cross-category matches.
  - Allows category-specific refinement.
  - Improves recommendation accuracy.
